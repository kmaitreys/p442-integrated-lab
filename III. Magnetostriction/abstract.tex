{\large {\bf  ABSTRACT }}

Magnetostriction is a property exhibited by magnetic materials that causes them to change their shape or dimensions during the process of magnetization. This report investigates the phenomena of magnetostriction in the rods of Nickel, Iron and Copper by using a Michelson interferometer setup. The results showed that the magnetostriction effect was present in both Ni and Fe rods but absent in the Copper rod. Further, the effect of altering the arm lengths of the interferometer was examined. The effectiveness of this setup to study magnetostrictive effects was also discussed. Instruments interfaced with a LabVIEW program were used to record and export the data.
