\begin{enumerate}
	\item We analysed the coupled oscillator and the analogies with the classical coupled oscillator were verified.
	\item It was found that the phase change of its displacement after
	one Rabi period is roughly equal to the dynamic phase of the coupled oscillator.
	\item The geometric phase in the coupled oscillator as measured from the
	experiment is found to be in very good agreement with the expected phase based on theory of a two-state system.
	\item In our innovation part, we first theoretically derived how the damping will vary and then experimentally found the parameters of the decay law. We observed that it was in agreement with the theory (exponential decay of the form we derived).
	\item The decay law/parameters depend on the mass on the oscillators to as it is apparent that a massive body will dampens slowly as compared to a lighter object due to inertia. We could have recorded the masses for better validation.
