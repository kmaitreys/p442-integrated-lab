{\large {\bf  ABSTRACT }}

We study the analogy between a classical coupled oscillator system with a two-level quantum system by analysing its geometric phase. By exploiting the cyclic dynamics of the system, we establish and verify the analogy between the two regimes. Further, we investigate the effects of a mechanical dissipative agent on the coupled oscillator theoretically and experimentally. We model our coupled oscillator and verify the quality of fit by analysing the correlation matrix. In our findings, the fit parameters were poorly correlated implying good quality fit and the mechnical dissipative agent was found to be causing an exponential decay to the system.
