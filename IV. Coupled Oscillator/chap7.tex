\chapter{\label{summary}Summary and Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have experimentally demonstrated that the classical system of coupled oscillators evolves
	in a manner similar to a two-state atom interacting with a laser. 
	\item  This analogy may be used to
	simulate in classical coupled oscillators various phenomena associated with the dynamics of
	quantum mechanical systems
	\item  The Rabi model parameters of the equivalent two-level
	quantum mechanical system have been calculated, and the geometric phases associated with
	the cyclical evolution have been estimated and found to be in very good agreement with the
	expected values
	\item In the future, this experiment can be expanded to other ways of modelling damping/decay observed in two-level quantum systems as we did mechanically here. One way to do it is to do it electromagnetically by exploiting the use of eddy currents.
