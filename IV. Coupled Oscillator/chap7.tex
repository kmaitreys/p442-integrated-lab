\chapter{\label{summary}Summary and Conclusions}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item We have experimentally demonstrated that the classical system of coupled oscillators evolves
	in a manner similar to a two-state atom interacting with a laser. 
	\item  This analogy may be used to
	simulate in classical coupled oscillators various phenomena associated with the dynamics of
	quantum mechanical systems
	\item  The Rabi model parameters of the equivalent two-level
	quantum mechanical system have been calculated, and the geometric phases associated with
	the cyclical evolution have been estimated and found to be in very good agreement with the
	expected values
	\item  This experiment can be used to get a better insight of the concept of
	geometric phase, which usually does not have any simple demonstration suitable for
	undergraduate students. The experiment described here can be easily reproduced in under-
	graduate laboratories with commonly available equipment.
